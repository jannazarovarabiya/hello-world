    <h1>My first individual website</h1>
    <p> I started learning programming on onemillionuzbekcoders platform almost a year ago.
    And i've learned quite a lot things so far. And i decided to develop my knowledge and to create my own website individually.
  That's why i created this. You can observe what i've learned and leave any comments or suggestions. </p>

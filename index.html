    <h1>My first individual website</h1>
    <p> I started learning programming on <a href="https://uzbekcoders.uz/">onemillionuzbekcoders</a>
    platform almost a year ago
    And i've learned quite a lot things so far. And i decided to develop my knowledge in the following website
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and created my own website individually.
  That's why i created this. You can observe what i've learned and leave any comments or suggestions. </p>
